## Brayden's Conclusion

## Jake's Conclusion
The fact that North Oakland ranked lowest in obesity rates was no surprise to me. As north oakland is an area in pittsbugh with many college students living this makes sense
to me as early 20s our matabolsim is considered to be really fast compared to when we are older. This is also reinforced by the fact that college students tend to be more active
than their adult counterparts.
