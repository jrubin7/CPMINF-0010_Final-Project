# Final-Project

## Team name: Group 5
## Introduction
When looking at all three metrics, number of stairs, obesity rates, and property value, Oakland consistently shows up in the top few neighborhoods, often being first, with respect to each of these metrics, thus cementing it as the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh.

## The Metric
Our metric to decide the "best" neighborhood in pittburgh is a combination of the least amount of steps, the lowest obesity rates, and the highest property value. As a group we decided that these three factors are nesary to make a perfect negihborhood. The three data sets can be found below.

## Brayden's Conclusion
The "best" neighborhood is a three way tie between Manchester, Lower Lawrenceville, and Regent Square. If we drop those, the best would be south shore with 4 steps in total. The "worst" neighborhood was South Side Slopes by a significant 1500 step margin. Following was Beechview and Perry South with 2473 and 1843 respectively. In the median, Oakland as a whole. Oakland is a good center piece as it has North and South that are both in the in the upper percentiles in terms of "bestness".
## Jake's Conclusion
The fact that North Oakland ranked lowest in obesity rates was no surprise to me. As north oakland is an area in pittsbugh with many college students living this makes sense to me as early 20s our matabolsim is considered to be really fast compared to when we are older. This is also reinforced by the fact that college students tend to be more active than their adult counterparts.
