## Brayden's Conclusion
The "best" neighborhood is a three way tie between Manchester, Lower Lawrenceville, and Regent Square. If we drop those, the best would be south shore with 4 steps in total. The "worst" neighborhood was South Side Slopes by a significant 1500 step margin. Following was Beechview and Perry South with 2473 and 1843 respectively. In the median, Oakland as a whole. Oakland is a good center piece as it has North and South that are both in the in the upper percentiles in terms of "bestness".
## Jake's Conclusion
The fact that North Oakland ranked lowest in obesity rates was no surprise to me. As north oakland is an area in pittsbugh with many college students living this makes sense
to me as early 20s our matabolsim is considered to be really fast compared to when we are older. This is also reinforced by the fact that college students tend to be more active
than their adult counterparts.
